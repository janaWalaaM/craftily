	<div id="container">

         <div id="texta2">
          <p>If you're a new plant parent, all of the care that goes into keeping your
			 houseplants happy can feel a little overwhelming at first. However, most 
			 of your plants won't need constant attention to stay healthy. Other than 
			 remembering to water, there are plenty of easy-care houseplants that will 
			 only need a little maintenance a few times each year. When you need to step 
			 in and do some pruning or snip away a few leaves that are starting to turn
			  yellow, these tips will give you the knowledge you need to care for your 
			  plants with confidence.</p>

        </div>

        <div id="texta2">
            <a>1. Watering Your Houseplants</a>

			<div><p id="texta2p" >All houseplants have slightly different watering requirements, 
				depending on how they're grown and changes in plant growth through 
				the seasons. It's best to water on an as-needed basis rather than by 
				a set calendar schedule. In general, plants grown in well-drained
				 potting mix in an appropriate-size container should be watered when
				  the top 1/2 to 1 inch of soil feels dry. Cacti and succulents need 
				  less water; flowering plants usually need slightly more.</p>

				<p id="texta2p">Overwatering is one of the most common causes of houseplant 
					death. If you're not sure how much to water, it's better to 
					err on the dry side than to give your plants too much moisture. 
					And when you do water, avoid splashing onto leaves and stems, 
					which can encourage diseases and leaf spotting.</p>
				</div>
        </div>

		<div id="texta2">
            <a>2. Fertilize Houseplants Periodically</a>

			<div><p id="texta2p">Like watering, there's not an easy rule to know how much to
				 fertilize: It depends on the plant's growth rate and age, and 
				 the time of year. Most houseplants put on a growth spurt in 
				 spring and summer, so this is the best time to fertilize them.
				  During the short days of fall and winter, most houseplants don't 
				  need much, if any, fertilizer. Follow label directions to know 
				  how much plant food to use.</p>

				<p id="texta2p">Like overwatering, it's important to avoid overfertilizing your
					 houseplants. Too much fertilizer can burn their roots and 
					 stunt their growth. For flowering varieties, use a fertilizer
					  in which the three numbers on the label (nitrogen, phosphorus,
					   and potassium, respectively) are relatively equal. If the 
					   nitrogen content is too high, the plant may grow a lot of leaves,
					    but few flowers. It's also a good idea to use a fertilizer that
						 includes micronutrients to avoid deficiencies.</p>
			</div>

		<div id="texta2">
            <a>3. Propagate Houseplants When Needed</a>

			<div><p id="texta2p">Several types of houseplants benefit from being propagated by 
				division or other methods once in a while. It helps to rejuvenate 
				an overgrown plant and encourage fresh growth. Plus, it's an 
				inexpensive way to get more plants out of the ones you already have.</p>

				<p id="texta2p">Some houseplants, such as bromeliads, send up new shoots at the
					 base of the plant or offsets, which you can divide and put into
					  new pots. Climbing houseplants such as philodendron and pothos 
					  form new roots where their stems come into contact with soil, 
					  so they're good candidates for starting new plants from cuttings.
					   And you can root new African violets from a single leaf; just put
					    the stem end in a bit of water for a couple of weeks.</p>

				<p id="texta2p" >Other houseplants, such as spider plant and strawberry begonia,
					 reproduce by sending out runners with new plantlets at the end. 
					 It's super simple to root these to start new plants; usually, 
					 you just need to soak the base of the plantlets in water for a 
					 few days to help them develop roots, and then you can plant them 
					 in soil.</p>
			</div>
        </div>

		<div id="texta2">
            <a>4. Repot Overgrown Houseplants</a>

			<div><p id="texta2p">Not sure if your houseplants need repotting? Check the root systems. 
				If the roots are circling the inside of the container, it may be time to
				 repot the plant. If the plant has outgrown its pot, you can transplant 
				 it into a slightly larger container. If you'd like to keep it in the 
				 same pot, trim off some of the roots with a sharp knife and replant 
				 it into the container using fresh potting soil.</p>

				<p id="texta2p">As you repot your houseplants, it's also a good time to divide 
					those with multiple stems to create new plants. Spring and summer 
					are the best seasons for repotting your houseplants.</p>
			</div>

        </div>


		<div id="texta2">
            <a>5. Remove Dust From Plants</a>

			<div><p id="texta2p">Almost all houseplants look better with regular cleaning. Dust 
				collects on leaves, so wash them with a gentle shower of room-temperature
				 water or dust them with a soft brush if the plants have hairy leaves 
				 (which can hold onto moisture and encourage disease). For plants with 
				 smooth leaves, you can also use a cloth to gently wipe away any dust 
				 that collects on leaves. Not only does this improve your plant's 
				 appearance, but it'll actually help it to soak up more light.</p>
			</div>

        </div>

		<div id="texta2">
            <a>6. Prune and Pinch Back Houseplants</a>

			<div><p id="texta2p">You can prune any time of the year, but fall is a natural time to
				 break out your pruning scissors after a summer of growth. The main 
				 reasons for pruning houseplants are to make them look better and keep
				them from getting too large. Similar to propagating, cutting overgrown
				houseplants back to 4 to 6 inches tall helps rejuvenate them. This
				technique is effective in encouraging new growth for trailing plants 
				such as Swedish ivy and pothos that may have become bare at their
			    bases. Try to make your cuts just above a set of buds or side shoots
			     on a stem you want to cut back. These are where the new growth will 
				start. Also, remove any dead or diseased leaves and stems to help prevent 
				the problem from spreading.</p>

				<p id="texta2p">Pinching means removing stem tips, either with your fingernails or pruners. 
				Pinch out the tip of a stem and the topmost leaves to encourage the growth 
				of side buds. Plants that grow rapidly often look best with frequent pinching 
				to keep them compact and fuller.</p>
			</div>

        </div>

		
		<div id="texta2">
            <a>7. Deadhead Flowers and Remove Dying Leaves</a>

			<div><p id="texta2p">Trim faded flowers from your plants to encourage more blooms and help
				 prevent disease problems. While you're at it, be sure to remove yellow, 
				 brown, or withered leaves. Use a narrow-blade hand pruner or sharp scissors
				  to make a clean cut without tearing the plant's stem. It's a good idea to 
				  wipe off the blades of your pruners with rubbing alcohol before moving on 
				  to a different plant to avoid spreading any pests and diseases.</p>
			</div>
			<img src="image/pc6.jpg" height="385" width="350"/>
        </div>


		<div id="texta2">
            <a>8. Control Insect Pests</a>

			<div><p id="texta2p">Several insects commonly attack houseplants. Insecticidal soap 
				is an easy-to-use, effective treatment for most soft-bodied pests 
				such as aphids and spider mites. A forceful spray of water from the 
				hose helps knock down the population of these pests, too. Rubbing 
				alcohol is effective on insects with waxy coatings such as scale and 
				mealybugs; dab it on with a cotton ball.</p>
				<p id="texta2p">No matter what treatment you use, be consistent. For fast-reproducing
				 pests such as aphids and spider mites, you may need to treat plants once
				 a week for a month or so to be rid of the pests.</p>
				 <p id="texta2p">Fungus gnats are tiny black flies that buzz around the soil and are
     				 common houseplant pests, though they're often confused with fruit
				  flies. You typically see fungus gnats in large numbers when plants
				   are overwatered. Allow the soil surface to dry between waterings 
				   and make sure to clear away any dead leaves on the soil surface. 
				   In extreme cases, you may want to try repotting your plant into
					 fresh soil and a clean container.</p>
