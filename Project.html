			<h2 id="divh2"> &nbsp;Do It Yourself (DIY) </h2>
			<p>You see and hear the acronym "DIY" everywhere, and you probably already know what<br>it stands for: "do it yourself." It's a pretty straightforward-sounding concept.<br>But "DIY" might conjure up totally different images for different people, because<br> really,it can be about so many things.<br> <br> Basically, DIY means that, instead of hiring a professional to do a particular <br>task or, instead of buying goods from a store or an artisan you're choosing to do<br> that task or create those products yourself with no direct help from an expert.<br> That doesn't mean you can't turn to resources for help if you use a YouTube<br> tutorial,or a book or blog post to find directions or get your project on the <br>right track, it still counts as doing it yourself. DIY is really about you seeking<br> out the knowledge and developing the skills you need to do something that you<br> would normally pay someone else to do for you.</p>
		</div>

		<br>
		Understandably, the "DIY" label gets added to a lot of projects, and basically, everything from patching a hole in a wall yourself to making your own bath bombs (or even kids' slime!) counts as a DIY project. And DIY goes beyond that, since it can also be applied to things like cutting your own hair, sewing your own clothes, decorating a cake, managing your own investments, and so much more.
